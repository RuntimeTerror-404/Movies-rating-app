This app is designed with flutter and news API(newsapi.org).

i didn't include complete flutter project in this repository but include core codebase files and pubspec.yaml along with main.dart.

so,
if you want to build some project using it, you just need to replace(or add) these repository files in your current flutter project and that's all.

Happy coding...
